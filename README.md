# LivestreamerGUI
A simple JavaFX GUI for the Livestreamer command line tool


This is a very basic GUI for Livestreamer (a command line tool that allows you to watch Twitch-Streams in VLC). 
Streams can be added via a textfile that will be created on first launch of the JAR-File.
If you add streams from twitch the online status will be checked, so you can see if the stream is online or not.

VLC and Livestreamer have to be installed.
Tested on Windows 10 with JRE 8u91.
