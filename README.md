# LivestreamerGUI
A simple JavaFX GUI for the Livestreamer command line tool


This is a very basic GUI for Livestreamer (a command line tool that allows you to watch Twitch-Streams in VLC). 
Streams can be added via a textfile that will be created on first launch of the JAR-File.

VLC and Livestreamer have to be installed.
Tested on Windows 10 with JRE 8u91.
